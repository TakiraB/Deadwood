Lights. Camera. Fall off the roof. Welcome to Deadwood, the board game all about acting (badly). Compete against your friends to make it (or break it) in the world of Hollywood, set in the Wild Wild West. Rehearse and act roles, upgrade your rank until you become the best of the best... or totally fail doing so. Your choice.

## Game Overview

You play against your friends to succeed in as many sets across the board as you can acting. The Player with the highest combination of rank, money and credits will be deemed the winner, AKA the best actor in the entire world.

## Setup

1. Download or clone the repository containing the Java files.
2. Ensure you have the necessary XML files (`board.xml` and `cards.xml`) in the project directory. They should be located in a folder called `xml` in the same directory as the project files. 

## How to Compile and Play

To compile and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```
   javac *.java

   ```
4. Run the main game loop (Deadwood.java) by running this:
   ```
   java Deadwood.java

   ```
5. Have fun!
